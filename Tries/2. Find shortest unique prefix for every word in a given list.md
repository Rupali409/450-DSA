# *Problem Statement :*

# *Solution 1 :*

## Explanation :

Maintain a count for every Trie Node, as soon as you encounter a node with count 1 return the word.

The only different function is the searchForUniquePrefix function

## Code :

```python
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = Node("/")

    def insert(self, node, word):
			# refer prev question for basic Trie logic

    def search(self, node, word):
			# refer prev question for basic Trie logic

    def searchForUniquePrefix(self, node, word):

        child = node.children.get(word[0])
        if child is None:
            return ""

        if child.count == 1:
            return word[0]

        if len(word) == 1:
            if child.count == 1:
                return word[0]
            else:
                return ""

        return word[0] + self.searchForUniquePrefix(child, word[1:])

    def delete(self, node, word):
			# refer prev question for basic Trie logic

def multiStringSearch():
    trie = Trie()

    strings = ["dog", "dove", "duck" ,"zebra"]

    for i in strings:
        trie.insert(trie.root, i)
    for i in strings:
        print(trie.searchForUniquePrefix(trie.root, i))

multiStringSearch()
```

## Optimal Time Space Complexity :

Insert and search costs O(key_length), however the memory requirements of Trie is O(ALPHABET_SIZE * key_length * N) where N is number of keys in Trie. There are efficient representation of trie nodes (e.g. compressed trie, ternary search tree, etc.) to minimize memory requirements of trie.
